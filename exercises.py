02a Exercises

These skills can be used in assignment 2. These exercises are designed to teach you about some more complex data and control structures

To answer these exercises, open the IDLE program that came with your Python installation. IDLE is a line-by-line Python interpreter.
You can copy lines from this file into IDLE to interpret them and produce a result. Then copy the result back to the following line in this file (after the #).
You will also need to answer several questions to show you understand what is happening. 


'''
# Paste the following lines into IDLE, and then enter the result in the comment following the block
example_list = [1,17,20]
s = 0
for e in example_list:
	s += e
print(s)
#1
#18
#38
# What do these five lines of code do?
# They take the list and add them, outputting a number for each result. (ex 1, then 1+17 =18, then 18+20 =38)

# --------------------------------------------------

# Paste the following lines into IDLE, and then enter the results in the comments following the block
example_set = {1,2,3,4,2,3,1,4,3,2,1}
print(example_set)
for c in range(3,10):
	if c in example_set:
		print('{count} is in the set'.format(count=c))
example_set_2 = {4,5,6,7}
example_set = example_set - example_set_2
print(example_set)
set_to_list = list(example_set)
print(set_to_list)
#{1, 2, 3, 4}
#3 is in the set
#4 is in the set
#{1, 2, 3}
#[1, 2, 3]
# What qualities of a python set do you see in the (above) example?
#no duplicates, ordered
# In what situations might a python set be a useful data structure?
#when trying to see how many uniques there are

# --------------------------------------------------

# Paste the following lines into IDLE, and then enter the results in the comments following the block
example_dictionary = { 'class':'Z-399', 'teacher':'Jason Francis', 'time':9.0, 5:12345 }
print(example_dictionary)
print(example_dictionary[5])
example_dictionary['time'] = '9:00'
print(example_dictionary)
students = ['James','Paige','George','Ruth','Gwen','Claire']
example_dictionary['students'] = students
print(example_dictionary)
print(example_dictionary['students'][2])
#{'class': 'Z-399', 'teacher': 'Jason Francis', 'time': 9.0, 5: 12345}
#12345
#{'class': 'Z-399', 'teacher': 'Jason Francis', 'time': '9:00', 5: 12345}
#{'class': 'Z-399', 'teacher': 'Jason Francis', 'time': '9:00', 5: 12345, 'students': ['James', 'Paige', 'George', 'Ruth', 'Gwen', 'Claire']}
#George
# What qualities of a python dictionary do you see in the (above) example?
#you can add to it, multiple data types, key:value
# Write a python dictionary that might describe a bicycle. I'll get you started. Think about what qualities a bicycle could have (top speed, mileage, pedals, seat height, etc)
bicycle = { 'color':'blue', 'wheels':[2], 'gears':[21], 'type':'road bike', 'surface':'road' }

# Paste the following lines into IDLE, and then enter the results in the comments following the block
def product_list(example_list):
	s = 1
	for e in example_list:
		s *= e
	return s
r = product_list([1,2,3])
print(r)
print(product_list([2,5,6]))
print(product_list([-2,3,-4,5,-6]))
#6
#60
#-720
# What is happening in the (above) example?
# They are being multiplied together and outputting the result

# Paste the following lines into IDLE, and then enter the results in the comments following the block
